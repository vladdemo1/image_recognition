## pyproject.toml 

This file tells tools like pip and build how to create your project

```
[build-system]
requires = [
    "setuptools>=42",
    "wheel"
]
build-backend = "setuptools.build_meta"
```
build-system.requires gives a list of packages that are needed to build your package. Listing something here will only make it available during the build, not after it is installed.

build-system.build-backend is the name of Python object that will be used to perform the build. If you were to use a different build system, such as flit or poetry, those would go here, and the configuration details would be completely different than the setuptools configuration described below.


# Setup.cfg setup
Using setup.cfg is a best practice, but you could have a dynamic setup file using setup.py

```
